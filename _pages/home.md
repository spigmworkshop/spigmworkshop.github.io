# When and Where
* **Date:** 28th July, 2023
* **Venue:** ICML 2023, Hawaii Convention Center, Room 323 
* **Schedule**: [here](/schedule/)

# Aim and Scope

Probabilistic inference addresses the problem of amortization, sampling, and integration of complex quantities from graphical models, while generative modeling captures the underlying probability distributions of a dataset. Despite promising results, probabilistic methods face challenges when applied to highly structured data. We aim to bring experts from diverse backgrounds together, from both academia and industry, to discuss the applications and challenges of probabilistic methods, emphasizing challenges in encoding domain knowledge in these settings. We hope to provide a platform that fosters collaboration and discussion in the field of probabilistic methods.

Relevant topics to this workshop include but are not limited to:

* Inference and generating methods for graphs, time series, text, video, and other structured modalities. 
* Unsupervised representation learning of high dimensional structured data.
* Scaling and accelerating inference and generative models on structured data.
* Uncertainty quantification in AI systems.
* Applications and practical implementations of existing methods to areas in science.
* Empirical analysis comparing different architectures for a given data modality and application.

# Call for Reviewers
~~If you are interested in reviewing for our workshop, please sign up this [google form](https://forms.gle/2SDYpf2bHoF86bAu8)~~

# Submission Guidelines
We solicit 4-page workshop papers (with unlimited references and appendix) following our [LaTeX template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/tckgkpshvhgm) (edited from ICML 2023 main conference paper template). Submit via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2023/Workshop/SPIGM).

## Poster Guidelines
If accepted, you can present your poster during the workshop. The poster will be in **portrait** orientation and up to **24"w x 36"h**

## Frequently asked questions
* **Will there be workshop proceedings?** No, this is a **non-archival** workshop. The research presented at this venue can be further refined from the feedback you receive and published somewhere else.

* **Can we submit concurrently to another workshop?** Yes, but you'll also have to check the rules of the other workshop.

* **Can I submit an already accepted paper?** No, unless there are substantial differences from the original work.

* **When will the submissions be made public?** They will be made public only after acceptance.

* **What modalities (images, audio, text etc.) are accepted?** We think structure exists in many different modalities, and encourage submissions of all data types.

* **Is the review process double blind?** Yes. We will be using the OpenReview platform.
